# Docker

- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applicaitons
- Manage infrastructures and applications
- Ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container
- Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to tun the application

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Uses of Docker

- Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments
- Containers are great for (CI/CD) workflows
- Responsive deployment and scaling 
- Running more workloads on the same hardware

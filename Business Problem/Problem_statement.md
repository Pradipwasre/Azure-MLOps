# Predictive Classification Problem

- Classfication refers to a predictive modelling problem where a class label is predicred for a given example of input data
- A classification can have real-values or discrete input variables
- Several Types: binary classification problem, multi-class classificaion problem and multi-label classfication problems
- Class labels are ofter string values and must be mapped to numeric values before being probided to an algorithm for modelling.
- Classification accuracy is a popular metric used to evaluate the performance of a model

# Problem Statement: 

## Objective 
- To assess if a cistomer's license should be issed (AAI), renewed (REV) or cancelled (AAC) depending on various parameters

## Machine Learning Problem
- Develop a machine learning model to learn relation of the target variable with the set of features available from the training  data

## Technology
- Python, h2o, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, Numpy

## Deployment
Deploy model in a scalble way so that business decision can be taken in near real time in assessing a customer's license status.


# Solution: 
- Code
- API
- Docker
- Container Registry
- Web App


# Predictive Classification Problem

- Classfication refers to a predictive modelling problem where a class label is predicred for a given example of input data
- A classification can have real-values or discrete input variables
- Several Types: binary classification problem, multi-class classificaion problem and multi-label classfication problems
- Class labels are ofter string values and must be mapped to numeric values before being probided to an algorithm for modelling.
- Classification accuracy is a popular metric used to evaluate the performance of a model.

# Introduction To Azure Repos: 

- Version Control Tools
- Software to keep track of changes in code
- Azure Repos offer 2 kinds of version control: 
    1. Git
    2. TFVC : Team Foundation Version Control

## 1. GIT: 
    - Distributed Version Control System
    - Platformand Environment friendly
    - Enables code review with pull requests
    - Branch protection with policies
    - Extend pull request with pull status
    - Enables code isolation with forks

## 2. TFVC:
    - Centralized version control system
    - Server workspaces and Local workspaces
    - Not good practice to use it anymore
